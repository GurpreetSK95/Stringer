<h3 align="center">Create localised string files for Android and iOS from a single CSV file.</h3>

[![Android Weekly]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Weekly-%23352-blue.svg )]( http://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-352 )

#### Why?
As an application grows, maintaining the same product communication gets harder on multiple platforms. Stringer solves this problem by generating platform specific string files from a common CSV file.
Currently, the generated files include `strings.xml` for Android and `localizable.strings` for iOS.

#### Working
Run `kscript stringer.kt <Path to your csv file>.csv`. Files will be generated in a directory named `StringerThings` on the same path.

See [kscript](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript) for installation and more information.


*OR*

1. Create the csv named `mobile-strings.csv` and place it in `$homeDirectory/Downloads`. The resulting file path should be `$homeDirectory/Downloads/strings.csv` (default path of a downloaded file).
2. Execute [`main()`](https://github.com/GurpreetSK95/Stringer/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/gurpreetsk/Main.kt) function.
3. The generated files are located in `$homeDirectory/Desktop/StringerThings` directory.


#### Features
See [sample csv](https://github.com/GurpreetSK95/Stringer/blob/master/mobile-strings.csv) for format.

1. Templating is supported: Any string between `<` and `>` will be replaced with `%s` for Android and `%@` for iOS.
2. Any line starting with `#` is treated as comment.
3. A `type` and `feature` can be provided and resource key is generated accordingly for them. Eg: The generated key for `no connection, No internet connection found, ERROR, user details` will be `error_user_details_no_connection`.

<b>Note</b>: Ordering matters. CSVs must be ordered as `KEY, ENGLISH VALUE, FOREIGN VALUE'
